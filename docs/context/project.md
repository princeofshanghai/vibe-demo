# PCC - Project Configuration Center

LinkedIn's current product catalog is fragmented, inconsistent, and difficult to manage. With over 500+ products and SKUs, there is no clear source of truth — making it nearly impossible to understand what LinkedIn sells, at what price, through which bundles or offers, and across which markets. This lack of clarity causes delays, confusion, and a heavy dependency on engineering for even minor updates.

Our 5-year vision is to build **Product Configuration Center (PCC)** into the **centralized source of truth for LinkedIn's entire product catalog**. PCC will power faster, more agile go-to-market (GTM) motions by enabling product managers, pricing teams, and business stakeholders to:

- Understand our product offerings clearly — including pricing, SKUs, bundles, supported channels, and markets — without relying on engineering
- Easily make changes to product configurations, pricing, and packaging without writing code
- Run GTM experiments (e.g., pricing, billing cycles, naming, descriptions) and measure their impact in real time, enabling more adaptive business strategies
- Compare how products perform across currencies, regions, and segments through integrated analytics
- Empower new and non-technical team members to navigate and manage the catalog with ease

By eliminating dependency on manual spreadsheets, tribal knowledge, and engineering bottlenecks, PCC will accelerate LinkedIn's GTM speed, support scalable experimentation, and lay the foundation for a modern, self-serve product ops platform. It will feel like a consumer-grade enterprise tool — fast, intuitive, and trustworthy.
