# High-level user story

## Persona
**Tiffany**, a senior PM on the LinkedIn Learning team, is leading a rebrand initiative to split her team’s offering into two SKUs: Learning and Career Hub. She wants to launch this change confidently across naming, pricing, and features — without relying on engineering or wasting time figuring out who to talk to.

## Concept
Tiffany opens the **Product Configuration Center (PCC)** and starts a new **Go-to-Market Motion**. She selects the existing Learning SKU, updates the name and description, adds additional features, and updates all online prices across markets. Once she’s ready, she submits the motion.

The system pushes the changes to **EI**, and automatically identifies and routes the required approvals to the right stakeholders in legal, tax, and finance. Tiffany can track who still needs to approve and follow the status in real time.

## Goals
By using PCC, Tiffany avoids office hour bottlenecks, no longer has to hunt down approvers manually, and doesn't depend on engineering to execute. She launches faster, with more confidence — and spends more time driving strategy, not chasing process.
