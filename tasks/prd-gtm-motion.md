# PRD: Go-to-Market Motion Feature

## Introduction/Overview

The Go-to-Market (GTM) Motion feature enables LinkedIn Product Managers to create, manage, and submit product configuration changes through a structured workflow. This feature allows PMs to update product names and descriptions within organized "motions" that track changes from creation through production deployment.

**Problem Statement:** PMs currently lack a streamlined way to manage product updates with proper tracking, approval workflows, and change visibility. This feature provides a self-service solution for managing product configuration changes without engineering dependencies.

## Goals

1. **Enable Self-Service Product Updates:** Allow PMs to independently create and manage product name/description changes
2. **Provide Change Tracking:** Offer clear visibility into what changes are being made and their current status
3. **Streamline Approval Workflow:** Automate the routing and tracking of required approvals
4. **Improve Change Organization:** Group related product updates into logical "motions" with clear activation dates
5. **Reduce Process Friction:** Eliminate manual processes and dependency bottlenecks for basic product updates

## User Stories

**Primary User Story:**
As a Product Manager, I want to create a Go-to-Market Motion with product name and description changes so that I can organize and track my product updates through a structured approval process.

**Supporting User Stories:**
- As a PM, I want to name my motion and set an activation date so that I can organize changes by initiative and timeline
- As a PM, I want to edit product names and descriptions and assign them to a motion so that all related changes are grouped together
- As a PM, I want to see all my motions in one place so that I can track the status of different initiatives
- As a PM, I want to submit my motion for approval so that my changes can move through the required workflow
- As a PM, I want to track motion status so that I know when my changes will go live

## Functional Requirements

### Motion Management
1. **Motion Creation:** Users must be able to create a new GTM Motion with a name and activation date
2. **Motion List View:** System must display a list of all GTM Motions with key details (name, status, activation date, created date)
3. **Motion Detail View:** Users must be able to view and edit motion details including name, activation date, and associated product changes
4. **Motion States:** System must support motion workflow states: Draft, Submitted, Pushing to EI, Approvals, Pushing to Production, In Production

### Product Updates
5. **Product Selection:** Users must be able to select products to modify either from the motion detail page or from individual product pages
6. **Name/Description Editing:** Users must be able to edit product names and descriptions
7. **Change Assignment:** When saving product changes, users must be able to assign changes to an existing motion or create a new motion
8. **Change Tracking:** System must show what product changes are included in each motion

### Navigation & User Experience
9. **Motion Creation Entry Points:** Users must be able to create motions from:
   - Global "Create Motion" button (lands on motion detail page)
   - Product detail pages (stays on product page with toast notification)
10. **Change Review:** Users must be able to review all changes before submitting a motion
11. **Status Tracking:** Users must be able to see current motion status and track progress through workflow
12. **Toast Notifications:** System must show confirmation when motions are created from product pages

### Workflow Management
13. **Motion Submission:** Users must be able to submit draft motions to move them into the approval workflow
14. **Approval Tracking:** System must show which approvals are required and their current status
15. **Status Updates:** Motion status must automatically progress through workflow states

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Pricing Changes:** This MVP will not include pricing modifications
- **Feature Management:** Adding/removing product features is out of scope
- **Real Database Integration:** Using mock data only for prototyping
- **EI Integration:** No actual external system integration required
- **User Authentication:** No login/permission management needed for prototype
- **Bulk Operations:** No mass editing or bulk product updates
- **Change History:** No detailed audit trail or change versioning
- **Email Notifications:** No actual email integration for approvals
- **Advanced Search:** No complex filtering or search capabilities for motions/products

## Design Considerations

### UI Components (Following Ant Design Guidelines)
- **Motion List:** Table component with status badges, sortable columns
- **Motion Detail:** Form layout with clear sections for motion details and product changes
- **Product Selection:** Modal or inline selection interface
- **Status Indicators:** Clear visual states using Ant Design's status components
- **Navigation:** Breadcrumb navigation between motions and products

### Visual Style
- Follow established PCC design patterns (minimal/clean, modern SaaS vibe)
- Use soft shadows and rounded corners for cards and containers
- Maintain generous whitespace and clear information hierarchy
- Implement clear call-to-action buttons for primary actions (Create, Submit, Save)

### Page Structure
- **GTM Motions List Page:** `/motions` - Overview of all motions
- **Motion Detail Page:** `/motions/:id` - Individual motion management
- **Product Pages:** Enhanced with motion assignment capabilities

## Technical Considerations

### Mock Data Requirements
- **Motion Data:** ID, name, activation date, status, created date, product changes array
- **Product Data:** ID, current name, current description, SKU information
- **Status Workflow:** Predefined state transitions and timing for demo purposes
- **Sample Data:** Realistic product names and descriptions for LinkedIn's product catalog

### Component Architecture
- Reusable motion status components
- Shared product selection interface
- Consistent form handling patterns
- Toast notification system integration

## Success Metrics

### User Experience Metrics
- **Task Completion Rate:** Users can successfully create and submit a motion with product changes
- **Navigation Efficiency:** Users can move between motion and product views without confusion
- **Change Clarity:** Users understand what changes are included in their motions before submission

### Prototype Validation Metrics
- **Workflow Comprehension:** Stakeholders understand the motion lifecycle and status progression
- **Interface Usability:** Users can complete typical tasks without guidance
- **Design Consistency:** Interface follows established PCC design patterns and guidelines

## Open Questions

1. **Motion Naming:** Should there be any validation or suggested naming conventions for motions?
2. **Product Change Limits:** Is there a maximum number of products that can be included in a single motion?
3. **Draft Persistence:** How long should draft motions be retained in the system?
4. **Cancellation:** Should users be able to cancel motions after submission, and at what stages?
5. **Change Conflicts:** How should the system handle if the same product is modified in multiple active motions?

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Core MVP)
- Motion list and detail pages
- Basic motion creation with name/activation date
- Product name/description editing with motion assignment
- Mock workflow status progression

### Phase 2 (Enhanced UX)
- Improved product selection interface
- Better status tracking and progress indicators
- Enhanced navigation between motions and products

### Phase 3 (Polish)
- Advanced mock data scenarios
- Edge case handling
- Refined visual design and interactions
